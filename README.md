## 🎯 How It Works 
The application uses: 
- useState to manage current song, progress, and play state
- useRef to control the HTML audio element
- onTimeUpdate event to update progress dynamically 
- onEnded event to automatically play the next track

## 💡 Future Improvements 
- Add volume control 
- Add shuffle / repeat modes 
- Add playlist selection UI 
- Deploy backend for dynamic song loading
